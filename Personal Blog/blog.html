            <h1>Things To Do Before And After Starting A New Blog.</h1>
            <p>Blogging is about expressing your feelings and sharing your knowledge with others, it is about converting your passion into profession. Before writing about anything you need to have a deep knowledge on that particular topic because it will not only help you in writing content but also help others to understand what you are trying to share with them.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote>Starting a blog is not about buying a domain<br>hosting and never start working on it<br/> or working without any knowledge on that topic.
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            <p>In this article I will help you with things you need to do before and after starting a new blog. This will help you in growing & optimising your site and making it user friendly also making it look professional to others, because if someone visit your blog and find out your blog looks bulky and managed unprofessionally then he will never visit your blog again and he/she finds out that your blog is maintained by professional and they can easily find their solution then they will visit your blog again and again whenever they face a problem on your niche.</p>

            <i>Latent Semantic Indexing are keywords related to your main keyword, these keywords are words that are frequently found together because they share the same context. For examples your page or blog is about ‘Mobile Phone’ then you could be writing about any of the following context related to ‘Mobile Phone’</i>
